```js
function isMatch(s, p) {
  const m = s.length;
  const n = p.length;
  
  // Create a 2D DP table to store whether s[0:i] matches p[0:j]
  const dp = new Array(m + 1);
  for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
    dp[i] = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);
  }
  
  // Base case: an empty pattern matches an empty string
  dp[0][0] = true;
  
  // Handle patterns with '*'
  for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
    if (p[j - 1] === '*') {
      dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2];  // Zero occurrences of the preceding element
    }
  }
  
  // Fill in the DP table
  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (p[j - 1] === s[i - 1] || p[j - 1] === '.') {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
      } else if (p[j - 1] === '*') {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2] || (dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] === p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] === '.'));
      }
    }
  }
  
  return dp[m][n];
}

// Example usage:
const s1 = "aa";
const p1 = "a";
console.log(isMatch(s1, p1));  // Output: false

const s2 = "aa";
const p2 = "a*";
console.log(isMatch(s2, p2));  // Output: true

const s3 = "ab";
const p3 = ".*";
console.log(isMatch(s3, p3));  // Output: true
```

The provided JavaScript solution is a dynamic programming approach that efficiently solves the problem of regular expression matching. It uses a 2D DP table to avoid recomputation of overlapping subproblems, making it an optimized and efficient solution.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where 'm' is the length of the string 's' and 'n' is the length of the pattern 'p'. This is considered an optimized solution for this problem given the constraints of the problem (1 <= s.length, p.length <= 20), as it runs in a reasonable time for input sizes within these constraints.

While there may be other ways to solve this problem, this dynamic programming approach is widely accepted and efficient. If you have specific performance concerns or constraints that go beyond the problem statement, further optimizations may be necessary, but for most practical purposes, this solution is sufficient.
