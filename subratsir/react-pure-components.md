# What are React Pure Components ?

React Pure Components are class components that extend React.PureComponent. If a class component is extending React.Component, then we need a shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle Method. But in case of React Pure Component,  If the previous value of state or prop and the new value of state or prop is not the same, then only it will re-render. It means, Pure Components restricts the re-rendering when there is no use of re-rendering of the component.
