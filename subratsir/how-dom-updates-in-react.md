- The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where a “virtual” representation of a UI is kept in memory.
- Whenever there is a change in the state, React updates the nodes in the virtual DOM.
- React compares virtual DOM with real dom and update the changes. This process of updation is called reconciliation and the algorithm used is diffing algorithm.
