"Reversing the Second Half" algorithm is a common approach used to determine whether a given integer is a palindrome without converting the integer to a string.

Here's a breakdown of how the algorithm works:

- **Handle Special Cases:** Negative numbers and numbers ending with 0 cannot be palindromes, so we return false for those cases.

- **Reversing the Second Half:** We iteratively reverse the second half of the number by extracting its last digit and adding it to a new number (reversedHalf). We keep removing the last digit from the original number (x) during each iteration.

- **Comparison:** The loop continues until the remaining part of the original number (x) becomes smaller than or equal to the reversed second half (reversedHalf). This way, we've effectively reversed the second half of the number.

- **Even vs. Odd Length:** After the loop, we need to compare x and reversedHalf to determine if the original number is a palindrome. For even-length palindromes, x and reversedHalf will be equal. For odd-length palindromes, the middle digit doesn't matter, so we can ignore it by dividing reversedHalf by 10 and comparing it with x.

This algorithm is efficient and avoids the string conversion that is commonly used in simpler solutions. It's a clever way to tackle the problem of checking integer palindromes.
