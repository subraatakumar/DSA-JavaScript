# Difference between normal function and arrow function

- Arrow functions do not have their own this value. The value of this inside an arrow function is always inherited from the enclosing scope.
- Arrow functions do not have arguments array  
- If a function is constructable, it can be called with new, i.e. new User(). If a function is callable, it can be called without new (i.e. normal function call). Arrow functions are callable but not constructable.
