# SOLID principles

- S (Single-responsiblity Principle): A class or function or component should have only one job.
- O (Open-closed Principle): Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- L (Liskov Substitution Principle): Let p(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then p(y) should be provable for objects of y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
- I (Interface Segregation Principle): A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
- D (Dependency Inversion Principle): The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details.
