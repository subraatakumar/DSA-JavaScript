# Data Types in JavaScript

There are two types of data in JavaScript

- Primitive
- Non-Premitive : these type of data are also called objects

Primitive data types are of 

- String : data is enclosed with in single quote or double quote.
- Number : can be any number as well as decimal values
- Bigint : big numbers
- Boolean : either true or false
- Undefined : variable may be declared but any value is not assigned to it.
- Null : Variable is assigned null value. Intentionally data type is absent. typeof null is object.
- Symbol : It's constructor returns an unique symbol each time. 

Note that javascript is a loosely typed language. Data types are allocated dynamically. Unlike other programming languages like C and java no need to decalre the data type.
