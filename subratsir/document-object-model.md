# What is a DOM and why is it required ?

HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior to those web pages. When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the javascript can not understand the HTML document directly. So, DOM is a way to represent the webpage in a structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for javascript to access and manipulate elements by their tags, IDs, classes, Attributes, or Elements. DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects.
