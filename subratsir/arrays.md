# Arrays

An array is defined as a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. It is the simplest data structure where each element of the array 
can be accessed using its index number. Index number can be defined as a serial number which starts from zero (0).

## Properties

- Each element of the array is of the same data type and occupies same size in memory. 
- The elements of the array can be accessed by their index numbers. The index number is nothing but serial number starting from zero (0).
- The elements of the array are stored in contigous memory locations.

## Time Complexity of Various Operations

- Accessing an Element: As each element can be accessed through it's index number so time consumed is O(1) when index number of the element to be accessed is given.
- Finding an Element by value: As index is not known we have to visit through each elements so O(N) time.
- Updating an Element at specific index: O(1) time
- Updating a Value to another Value: O(N) time
- Inserting a value: O(N) time
