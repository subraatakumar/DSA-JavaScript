💡React Tip💡

As a React developer, the one extension which I use every day and become a fan of it is LocatorJS.

Use 𝗟𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗝𝗦 browser extension to quickly navigate to the source code in your favorite IDE (VS Code) by just clicking on any of the UI element displayed in the browser.

This extension is really useful when you have a large application and you want to find which file contains the code of the displayed UI.

Also, useful when the code is written by someone else and you want to debug the code.

Use 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻/𝗔𝗹𝘁 + 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗸 to navigate to source code.

Just give it a try. You will love it.

This extension becomes lifesaver when you're working with Material UI library code written by others and you want to find out the exact code for any part of the UI.

𝗣𝗦: This extension works with React, Preact, Solid, Vue and Svelte and almost all of the modern Browsers.
